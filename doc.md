In Dragon, comments are ignored during the execution of the program. They do nothing, they are only used make the code easier to understand.
### 1. Comments
```
// One line comment

/* This is a 
   multiline
   comment */
```

### 2. Variables
Here are the main types of variables in Dragon: integers, floats (decimal numbers), strings (text) and boolean (true or false).
There are other data types like arrays, maps, objects and functions.
```
a = 10  // integer
b = 2.09  // foat (deciaml number)
c = "Hello World!"  // character string
d = true  // Boolean (true or false)
```
