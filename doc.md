### 1. Comments
In Dragon, comments are ignored during the execution of the program. They do nothing, they are only used make the code easier to understand.
```
// One line comment

/* This is a 
   multiline
   comment */
```


### 2. Variables
Here are the main types of variables in Dragon: integers, floats (decimal numbers), strings (text) and boolean (true or false).
There are other data types like arrays, maps, objects and functions.
```
a = 10  // integer
b = 2.09  // foat (deciaml number)
c = "Hello World!"  // character string
d = true  // Boolean (true or false)
```


### 3. Input/Output

In Dragon, if you want to print a text in the console you don't even need to add a library. You simply need to use the command __show__ or __showln__:
```
show "Hello World"
// This will output "Hello World!"
```
You can use also use __showln__. It will add a line-return at the end of the text.

Now lets say you want to print the value of a variable. You simply have to write the name of your variable beside the command __show__:
```
a = 420
b = 69.96
c = "Hello There!"

showln a   // 420
showln b   // 69.96
showln c   // "Hello There!"
```

If you want your program to take an input it is also very simple.
```
select "std"

x = readln()
showln x
```
This simple 3 lines program ask the user to enter something and then prints what has been entered by the user.
Ps: Don't forget to add the __std__ module. This module contains many standard functions like __readln()__.


### 4. Conditions

Conditions in Dragon are pretty straightfoward. Here are some examples:
```
age = true

if(age)
{
    showln "That is true!"
} 
else
{
    showln "That is false!"
}
// Output: "That is true!"
```

```
age = 101

if(age > 21 && age < 100)
{
    showln "You are an adult"
} 
else if(age == 21)
{
    showln "You are a young adult"
}
else if(age <= 21 && age > 0)
{
    showln "You are a kid"
}
else
{
    showln "I think you are lying"
}
// In this case the output will be: "I think you are lying"
```

You can also use conditions to compare character strings. Here is an example:
```
name = "John Do"

if(name == "John Doe")
{
    showln name
}
else
{
    showln "What is your name?"
}
// Output: "What is your name?"
```
This small program with not output the text of our variable _name_ because it contains the text "John Do" and not "John Doe".
Here is a list of the relational operators you can use to compare values in Dragon:

&gt; greater than  
&lt; less than  
&gt;= greater than or equal  
&lt;= less than or equal  
== equal to  
!= not equal
